# Architecture

Accounted is a multi-tenant double-entry bookkeeping system built for Swedish
accounting law. This document explains how the system is put together and why
some parts are deliberately rigid. For contribution workflow, see
[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Overview

- **Framework**: Next.js (App Router) with React and TypeScript in strict mode.
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL with Row Level Security), which also
  provides auth (email/password plus TOTP MFA).
- **Deployment**: Vercel-hosted is the primary target; a Docker self-hosted
  setup is fully supported (see [docs/SELF-HOSTING.md](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md)).
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components. User-facing product language
  is Swedish and English (`messages/sv.json`, `messages/en.json`).

## The bookkeeping engine

All accounting writes flow through one engine: `lib/bookkeeping/engine.ts`.

The journal entry lifecycle is draft, then commit:

1. `createDraftEntry()` creates an uncommitted entry that can still change.
2. `commitEntry()` posts it. The voucher number is assigned atomically by the
   `commit_journal_entry` database RPC, which keeps numbering sequential per
   series. Swedish law requires an unbroken, explainable voucher sequence.
3. `createJournalEntry()` does both steps in one call.

Two invariants hold for every entry:

- Debits equal credits, and both sides are greater than zero.
- Once committed, an entry is never edited or deleted. Mistakes are corrected
  with reversal entries (storno): `reverseEntry()` cancels a voucher and
  `correctEntry()` replaces it (`lib/core/bookkeeping/storno-service.ts`).

If a gap still occurs in a voucher series (for example around imported
history), it must be documented, and the explanation is stored
(`voucher_gap_explanations`), following BFNAR 2013:2.

## Legal enforcement lives in the database

The rules above are not conventions; they are enforced by PostgreSQL triggers:

- Committed journal entries cannot be edited or deleted. The only change the
  triggers permit is the controlled status transition used by the storno flow
  (marking an entry as reversed).
- Writes to closed or locked accounting periods are rejected, as are writes
  behind a company-wide lock date.
- Documents linked to posted entries cannot be deleted; Swedish law requires
  7-year retention of accounting records.

Application code never works around these triggers. If a code path hits one,
the code path is wrong, not the trigger.

Two smaller invariants that show up everywhere in the codebase:

- Monetary amounts are rounded with `Math.round(x * 100) / 100`. String-based
  rounding such as `toFixed()` causes drift at the öre level and breaks entry
  balance.
- Account numbers are strings (`'1930'`, never `1930`). They are identifiers,
  not quantities.

## Multi-tenancy and security

Users belong to companies through `company_members`, and every business table
carries a `company_id`. Access control is layered:

- **Row Level Security** in PostgreSQL restricts rows to companies the user
  belongs to.
- **Explicit filtering**: queries still filter by `company_id` in code, as
  defense in depth, because service-role code paths bypass RLS.
- **Route guards**: API routes wrap a shared route context helper that
  resolves the authenticated user, the active company, and MFA enforcement in
  one place. Routes never hand-roll their own auth.

The active company is resolved server-side from the user's stored preference,
so the Next.js app and RLS always agree on which company is active.

## Extension system

Core is a complete accounting product on its own. Optional functionality
(AI categorization, receipt OCR, email, calendar, the MCP server, and more)
ships as extensions under `extensions/`, toggled by `extensions.config.json`.

The boundary is strict and CI-enforced:

- Core code never imports from `@/extensions/`. CI builds core with zero
  extensions enabled, so a direct import breaks the build.
- Extensions integrate through the event bus and documented extension APIs,
  and are wired via a generated static registry (`npm run setup:extensions`).

Licensing follows the same boundary: the project is AGPL-3.0, with an
extension exception that allows third-party extensions using only the
documented Extension API to be licensed under any terms. See
[LICENSE](LICENSE) and [docs/EXTENSIONS.md](docs/EXTENSIONS.md).

## Agent surface (MCP)

The bookkeeping engine is exposed as an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server
with over 100 tools, so AI agents can operate the ledger: list and categorize
transactions, draft vouchers, reconcile periods, generate reports and
declarations.

- Authentication uses scoped API keys (stored as SHA-256 hashes, rate limited
  per key).
- Posting operations are staged: an agent proposes an operation, and a human
  approves it before anything is committed to the journal.

## Events

`lib/events/bus.ts` is a module-level singleton event bus. Domain events (for
example "invoice created" or "transaction imported") are how extensions react
to core activity without core knowing about them.

## Repository map

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `app/` | Next.js App Router pages and API routes |
| `lib/bookkeeping/` | Engine, entry generators, account mapping, BAS chart data |
| `lib/core/` | Periods, year-end, storno, tax codes, audit, documents |
| `lib/reports/` | Balance sheet, income statement, VAT, SIE, tax reports |
| `lib/` (other) | Invoices, transactions, imports, salary, reconciliation, tax, providers |
| `components/` | React components (shadcn/ui based) |
| `extensions/` | Opt-in extension plugins |
| `supabase/migrations/` | Database schema, RLS policies, enforcement triggers |
| `packages/gnubok-mcp` | Published MCP bridge package |
| `messages/` | Swedish and English UI strings |
| `tests/` | Shared test helpers and fixtures |
| `docs/` | Self-hosting, Docker, extensions, white-label guides |

## Testing

- Unit and route tests run on Vitest with mocked Supabase clients
  (`npm test`).
- Database behavior (triggers, RPCs, RLS) is tested against a real PostgreSQL
  instance in `*.pg.test.ts` files (`npm run test:pg`), because mocking cannot
  prove trigger semantics.
