## Why Accounted?

**Compliant by construction.** Accounted implements double-entry bookkeeping under Swedish accounting law (Bokföringslagen). Voucher immutability, sequential voucher numbering, period locks, and 7-year document retention are enforced by database triggers, not by convention. Corrections are made the legal way, with reversal entries (storno), never by editing history. See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for how.

**Agent-native.** The full bookkeeping engine is exposed as 100+ MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools with scoped API keys, so an AI agent can do the books in Accounted: categorize transactions, draft vouchers, reconcile periods, and prepare declarations. Posting is staged for human approval, so the agent proposes and you decide.

**Yours to run.** AGPL-3.0 licensed and fully self-hostable with Docker and Supabase. Use the hosted version at [app.gnubok.se](https://app.gnubok.se) or run your own.

## Self-Hosting

```bash
git clone https://github.com/erp-mafia/accounted.git
cd accounted
./setup.sh              # Prompts for Supabase credentials, generates .env
docker compose up -d
```

You need a Supabase project and must apply the database migrations before first use. See [docs/SELF-HOSTING.md](docs/SELF-HOSTING.md) for the full step-by-step guide, including Supabase setup, auth configuration, optional features (AI, email, push notifications), and troubleshooting.

## Development Setup

npm test          # Run tests
npm run build     # Production build
npm run lint      # ESLint
```
