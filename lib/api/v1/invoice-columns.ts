/**
 * Shared v1 invoice response projections.
 *
 * The create (POST), detail (GET), and draft-update (PATCH) endpoints all
 * return the same invoice shape; keeping the column lists in one module
 * prevents response-shape drift between them (a PATCH caller must see the
 * same fields a GET caller does). Explicit projection: excludes user_id,
 * company_id (internal scoping) and the encrypted personnummer blob
 * (deduction_personnummer_last4 is the display-safe representation).
 * Schema migrations adding columns must update these lists before the
 * field becomes visible on the public API.
