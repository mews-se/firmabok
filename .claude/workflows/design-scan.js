// Pattern: fan-out (one agent per page) -> adversarial verify (skeptic per finding) -> synthesize.
// This workflow only PRODUCES verified findings. The loop-design-scan skill dedupes + files the
// GitHub issues (workflow agents shouldn't take high-privilege outward actions).

status colors via <Badge variant> only (no bg-blue-100 / bg-emerald-500/10 as chrome); use the
primitives PageHeader/Table/EmptyState/Skeleton/InfoTooltip (hand-rolled equivalents are violations);
Hedvig serif display must NOT be font-medium; financial numbers need tabular-nums; motion is
transition-colors only (no press-scale/hover-lift/spring); a11y WCAG AA, aria-label on icon buttons,
visible focus, touch targets >=40px. Locked 2026-07 migration conventions (numbered list in design.md):
frame layout with pill Buttons (per-call-site rounded-* overrides are violations); cards flat and
shadow-free (shadow-* on a card is a violation; overlays keep shadows); one-line table rows (sub-rows
are violations); chips mark exceptions only (same Badge on every row is a violation); attention is one
.attn sentence, banners are violations; help behind the "?" popover after the H1; one context picker
far right in the toolbar (FyPicker/ContextPicker); confirm-up-front dialogs, not outcome text written
into the page; .stagger-enter on list entry; settings tabs use the Fonster row language (flat hairline
rows, switches, dirty-only sticky save bar). A "finding" must cite file:line and the exact rule it breaks.`
