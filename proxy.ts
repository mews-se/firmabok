     * NOTE: `/api` is intentionally INCLUDED so the proxy can enforce the MFA
     * (AAL2) gate on cookie-authenticated API calls (updateSession short-
     * circuits API routes after that check: see lib/supabase/middleware.ts).
     *
     * `/rl` is the PostHog reverse-proxy prefix (rewrites in next.config.ts).
     * It MUST be excluded: middleware runs BEFORE next.config rewrites, so
     * without this updateSession() treats an ingestion POST as an unknown
     * protected path and 307s it to /login. That silently kills analytics on
     * every logged-out page and, because flags and asset loads still succeed
     * through the rewrite, the integration looks healthy while no events
     * arrive. Keep in sync with `api_host` in instrumentation-client.ts.
