/**
 * Cross-company PSD2 session reuse.
 *
 * Several ASPSPs (SEB most visibly) allow only one active AIS session per PSU.
 * A user who signs for company A, then company B, then company C at the same
 * bank ends up with only the newest session alive: each authorization revokes
 * the previous one bank-side, without telling us. Prod bears this out: every
 * SEB customer holding connections for more than one company has had an
 * earlier company stop syncing at the moment the next one was authorized,
 * usually while its consent was still formally valid for weeks.
 *
 * The fix is to stop minting one session per company. Enable Banking's
 * authorization is per-PSU, not per-company: POST /auth carries no account
 * restriction, so the returned session already covers every account the user
 * ticked at the bank, and GET /accounts/{uid}/transactions takes no session id
 * at all. So a second company can simply point at the first company's session
 * and sync its own accounts from it, with no second BankID and nothing revoked.
 *
 * What is shared is exactly the consent: `session_id` and `consent_expires`.
 * Everything else stays per-company — its own bank_connections row, its own
 * accounts_data subset, its own cash_accounts and transactions. Company B's
 * row never carries an account company A already claimed, so the shared
 * session is not a window into another company's books.
